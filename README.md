# Caltech 101 Classification using CLIP and PyTorch Lightning

This project classifies the Caltech 101 dataset using the CLIP model for feature extraction and a lightweight neural network for classification. The task involves:
- Utilizing CLIP embeddings for classification.
- Training the classifier using PyTorch Lightning.
- Logging metrics with wandb.
- Running experiments on Google Colab.

## Steps
1. Load the Caltech 101 dataset.
2. Extract image embeddings with CLIP.
3. Train a lightweight classifier.
4. Log results with wandb.
